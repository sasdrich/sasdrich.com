I am head of the [Emmy Noether](https://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/individual/emmy_noether/index.html) research group on "Computer-Aided Verification of Physical Security Properties (CAVE)" at the [Chair for Security Engineering](https://informatik.rub.de/seceng), [Ruhr-Universität Bochum](https://ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en), Germany.

Before, I worked as a Senior Hardware Security Engineer at the Rambus Cryptography Research Group located in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. I obtained my PhD (Dr.-Ing.) in 2018 on the topic of "Cryptographic Hardware Agility for Physical Protection" under the supervision of [Prof. Dr.-Ing. Tim Güneysu](https://informatik.rub.de/seceng/personen/gueneysu) at the Ruhr-Universität Bochum, Germany.

My current research focuses on *Hardware Security* and *Secure Design*. For this, I work on new concepts and approaches for *Hardware Security Verification* and *Computer-Aided Security* to enable efficient and automated protection of hardware implementations through sophisticated and specialized *Security-Aware Electronic Design Automation* tools.
