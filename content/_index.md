I am head of the research group on *Computer-Aided Verification of Physical Security Properties (CAVE)* hosted at the [Faculty of Computer Science](https://informatik.rub.de/en/), [Ruhr-Universität Bochum](https://ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en), Germany. My group is funded by the [Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft](https://www.dfg.de/en/) (DFG, German Research Foundation) as part of the [Emmy Noether Programme](https://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/individual/emmy_noether/index.html).

Before, I worked as a Senior Hardware Security Engineer at the Rambus Cryptography Research Group located in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. I obtained my PhD (Dr.-Ing.) in 2018 on the topic of *Cryptographic Hardware Agility for Physical Protection* under the supervision of Prof. Dr.-Ing. Tim Güneysu at the Ruhr-Universität Bochum, Germany.

My current research focuses on *Hardware Security* and *Computer-Aided Security Engineering*. For this, I work on new concepts and approaches for *Hardware Security Verification* and *Security-Oriented Electronic Design Automation* to enable efficient and automated protection of hardware implementations through sophisticated and specialized security-aware design and verification tools.
